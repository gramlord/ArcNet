ArcNet is an nRF24L01+ based network for Arduino.

This can be used as the basis for an application that requires many
Arduino servers to communicate data, such as a sensor network.

Features include:
  - Up to 254 nodes in a network.
  - Network topology is a tree structure, but is not constrained
    by the nRF24L01+ 6-pipe limit.
  - One special node, node 0 or the Root Node, is the administrative
    centre for the network and performs tasks such as node number
    assignment and pairing to the network, node joining and routing changes.
  - Dynamic routing so a node may join the network at any
    location within the tree, and may at any time leave and rejoin
    in another location. This means network breaks through loss of,
    or interference to, radio signal is gracefully handled automatically.
  - Node-to-node communications, no matter where the nodes are on
    the network.
  - Broadcast messages.
  - Message payload up to 27 bytes.
  - Unreliable message transfer, in the style of UDP.

ArcNet is currently in devlopment with most of these features have been
implemented and tested. Expect to see the first release soon.

Here's what's required:
  - On each Arduino, dedicated to ArcNet:
    - an nRF24L01+ radio
    - a led
    - a button
    - 64 bytes of EEPROM space
  - Software:
    - the ArcNet library, of course
    - the RF24 library by Maniacal Bits. Brilliant library, BTW.
    - the ArcSched library, by yours truely
    - the ArcLed library
    - the ArcButton library
  - To this you add your sensors to each Arduino, and add your software
    that uses ArcNet's message sending and receiving functions. I'd suggest
    you use ArcSched to initiate any timing-related funcitons, such as
    to regularly check your sensors.

Future functionality that may or may not be implemented:
  - A reliable message transfer mechanism.
  - Ability of nodes to go to sleep to save power.
  - Radio channel hoopping and scanning.
  - Port all the Arc* libraries to the Raspberry Pi. The Pi
    can then be a node on the network, even the Root Node.
